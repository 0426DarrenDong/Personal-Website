This is a Repo showcasing my AboutMe Page from the TKH fellowship. 


This webpage contains multiple html files for each different pages. Each html file delivers a different topic about me. Each page contains a navgiation bar that can be clicked to go to another page. Beneath every page also contains logos of social media that can be clicked to reach their respective location. The following contains more information about each page: 
- The index.html page creates the initial front cover page with a basic introduction and a image of myself. It gives an overall idea of my education, my programming knowledge, and my hobbies. This page uses css from style.css as well as Bootstrap and uses JavaScript from script.js.  
- The education.html page gives a more indepth information on my education. It contains a paragraph on my programming timeline, my life in elementary school, my life in middle school, and my current (high school) life. This page uses css from style.css and JavaScript from script.js. 
- The hobbies.html page lists and descriobes a certain hobbies. It discusses what I like to do, such as programming and playing games, as well as what I do on my free time outside of school work. This page uses css from style.css and JavaScript from script.js. 
- The contact.html page contains infomration on how to reach me, such as email and phone number. It also contains a form that asks for comments, but in reality, the form does not do anything significant at the moment. This page uses css from style.css and Bootstrap and JavaScript from script.js. 
- The thanks.html page is only accessable until the form in contact.html is submitted. The website will direct to another page that gives the user gratitude for commenting and spending time on my website. It also reminds the user that the logos below are possible ways to reach out to me. This page uses css from style.css and JavaScript from script.js.  


The website contains a style.css file. This css file creates the "skin" of the webite. It created the background of the entire website and the location and color of certain aspect of the web. The css file helped created the navigation bar and the footer social media logos so that when the page expands, the footer will always be at the bottom. 

The website contains a script.js file. This file creates the function and the event listeners in the website. It what caused the color of the navigation bar and the headers in education.html and hobbies.html to change color when hovering over them. It also helped created the submit button in contact.html and gives an alert when any of the three inputs in contacts.html is empty.
